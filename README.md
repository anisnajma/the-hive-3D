# Setting Up Development Environment
### Project Structure
* Every three.js project needs at least one HTML file to define the webpage.
* JavaScript file to run the three.js code.

##### Default structure & naming
* _index.html_

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>My first three.js app</title>
		<style>
			body { margin: 0; }
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```
* _main.js_
```
import * as THREE from 'three';
...
```
* _public/_
     - Textures, audio, and 3D models will go here.

### Installation
Install with NPM and a build tool

1. Install Node.js. We'll need it to load manage dependencies and to run our build tool.
2. Install three.js and a build tool, Vite, using a terminal in your project folder. Vite will be used during development, but it isn't part of the final webpage. If you prefer to use another build tool, that's fine — we support modern build tools that can import ES Modules.
