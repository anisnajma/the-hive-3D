# The Hive 3D
The Hive Interactive 3D City (Three.js)
This uses Vite as web server
Node.js as server-side client feature

# Project Objective
1. to produce an interactive 3D city model using 3.js Library
# Project Planning
1. Render 3D File into Three.js
   - [x] Set up development environment ðŸ’»
   - [ ] Explore three.js ðŸš€
   - [ ] ???
3. Asset Development
   > 3D City Model
   > 3D Character Model
4. Implement behaviour
    >Walking Around the City
    >Display city/ place information and SDG related

# Setting Up Development Environment
### Project Structure
* Every three.js project needs at least one HTML file to define the webpage.
* JavaScript file to run the three.js code.

##### Default structure & naming
* _index.html_

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<title>My first three.js app</title>
		<style>
			body { margin: 0; }
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<script type="module" src="/main.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
```
* _main.js_
```
import * as THREE from 'three';
...
```
* _public/_
     - Textures, audio, and 3D models will go here.

### Installation
Install with NPM and a build tool

1. Install Node.js. We'll need it to load manage dependencies and to run our build tool.
2. Install three.js and a build tool, Vite, using a terminal in your project folder. Vite will be used during development, but it isn't part of the final webpage. If you prefer to use another build tool, that's fine â€” we support modern build tools that can import ES Modules.

### Steps
1. git clone this repo into your project folder path (locally)
2. install node into your project folder path (server side feature)
3. install three.js into your project folder path (render 3D graphic)
4. install vite into your project folder path (local server)
5. Run server on localhost:8080
6. Start coding!
